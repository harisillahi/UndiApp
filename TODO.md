## 🔄 CURRENT SESSION: Individual Winner Redraw with "Berhenti" Button in WinnerList

### Progress Tracker

#### ✅ Completed Steps:
1. ✅ **Analyzed current React implementation** - Understood existing redraw functionality
2. ✅ **Compared with HTML version** - Identified key requirement: "Berhenti" button in WinnerList table
3. ✅ **Created comprehensive implementation plan** - Detailed step-by-step approach
4. ✅ **Identified core requirement** - "Berhenti" button should appear in WinnerList table, not drawing window

#### 🔄 Current Step:
**Step 1: Update Lottery Context (src/context/LotteryContext.tsx)**
- [ ] Add `currentRedrawWinnerId: string | null` to state
- [ ] Add `slotIndex: number` property to Winner type
- [ ] Update `addWinner` function to include slotIndex
- [ ] Add `startRedraw(winnerId: string)` function
- [ ] Add `stopRedraw()` function
- [ ] Update `updateWinner` to preserve slotIndex

#### 📋 Remaining Steps:
**Step 2: Update Drawing Window (src/app/drawing-window/page.tsx)**
- [ ] Update `stopDrawing()` to assign slotIndex when calling `addWinner`
- [ ] Simplify `handleIndividualRedraw()` to use `winner.slotIndex`
- [ ] Update redraw to set `currentRedrawWinnerId` in context
- [ ] Update `handleStopRedraw()` to clear redraw state
- [ ] Enhance localStorage communication handling

**Step 3: Update WinnerList Component (src/components/WinnerList.tsx)**
- [ ] Add redraw state display logic
- [ ] Show "Berhenti" button when `state.currentRedrawWinnerId === winner.id`
- [ ] Update `handleRedrawWinner()` to set redraw state
- [ ] Add `handleStopRedraw()` function
- [ ] Add visual indicators for winner being redrawn

**Step 4: Testing and Validation**
- [ ] Test individual winner redraw functionality
- [ ] Verify "Berhenti" button appears in correct table row
- [ ] Test cross-window communication
- [ ] Validate UI/UX improvements

### Key Requirements:
1. **"Berhenti" button in WinnerList table** - When a winner is being redrawn, show "Berhenti" button in that winner's row
2. **Reliable slot identification** - Use slotIndex property to accurately target winner's position in drawing grid
3. **Cross-window communication** - Maintain sync between control panel and drawing window
4. **Visual feedback** - Clear indicators showing which winner is being redrawn
5. **Error handling** - Graceful handling of edge cases and communication failures

### Implementation Strategy:
- Add redraw state management to context
- Use slotIndex for reliable winner-to-slot mapping
- Show "Berhenti" button in WinnerList table row (not drawing window)
- Maintain existing modern UI/UX with Tailwind CSS
- Preserve all current functionality while adding individual redraw
