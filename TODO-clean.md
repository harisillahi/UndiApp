## Key Requirements
1. **"Berhenti" button in WinnerList table** - When a winner is being redrawn, show "Berhenti" button in that winner's row
2. **Reliable slot identification** - Use slotIndex property to accurately target winner's position in drawing grid
3. **Cross-window communication** - Maintain sync between control panel and drawing window
4. **Visual feedback** - Clear indicators showing which winner is being redrawn
5. **Error handling** - Graceful handling of edge cases and communication failures

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on making "Berhenti" button appear in WinnerList table, not drawing window
- Ensure reliable slot identification using slotIndex property
- Maintain modern UI/UX with Tailwind CSS
